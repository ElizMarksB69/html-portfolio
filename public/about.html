<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Elizabeth Marks, I live in Durban - South Africa. I am a software
  developer. In my 23 years of experience as a software developer, I have had
  the privilege of working with diverse teams where we embraced a culture of
  continuous learning and innovation. One of the most rewarding aspects of my
  journey has been the daily application of newly acquired knowledge and skills.
  Rather than relying solely on formal certifications or diplomas, my focus has
  always been on practical experience and hand-on learning. By actively
  participating in collaborative projects, I honed my expertise in various
  programming languages, frameworks, and tools, enabling me to contribute
  effectively to the effectively to the teamâ€™s success.
